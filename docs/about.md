# About

## Team

[CCBR](https://ccbr.ccr.cancer.gov/) and [NCBR](https://ncbr.ncifcrf.gov/) are umbrella organizations providing collaborative bioinformatics support to 300+ investigators across the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and NIAID. Our development team includes members with a diversity of experiences and expertise, ranging from NGS analyses, statistics, population genetics, application development, and computational data science.

## Project

In addition to providing bioinformatics support, we are actively engaged in technical development projects aimed at establishing best-practices for NGS data analysis. We extensively test and benchmark every tool that is added to our pipelines. Our comprehensive benchmarking of different tools and methods has accumulated in a set of best practices pipelines for the analysis of WGS/WES, RNA-seq, miR-seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-seq, Microarray, and Single-cell datasets. Pipeliner provides directly access to these pipelines.
