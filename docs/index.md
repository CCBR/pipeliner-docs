# Welcome to Pipeliner

An open-source, reproducible, and scalable solution for analyzing NGS data. 

Pipeliner provides access to the same best-practices pipelines developed and benchmarked by bioinformatics analysts at [CCBR](https://ccbr.ccr.cancer.gov/) and [NCBR](https://ncbr.ncifcrf.gov/). This repository is the main source of documentation for users and developers working with or contributing to [Pipeliner](https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner).

Our goal is to provide a mechanism or framework for researchers to employ robust, scalable, and reproducible scientific analysis. Over the years, Pipeliner has enabled users across the NIH to meet their research goals-- resulting in dozens of publications and over 16 million hours of compute!
